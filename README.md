Purpose

For this assignment, I will be interpreting and cleaning data. I digged through and interpreted
the data. The majority of my time was spent searching through the data for inconsistencies, errors, 
and misrepresentations. This was done in pgAdmin. The focus is more on my ability to consider the 
data thoroughly and then perform tasks to make the data more useful.
